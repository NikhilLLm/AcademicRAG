## Notes
### Problem / Motivation
The paper addresses the problem of automated machine learning (AutoML), specifically focusing on model selection and hyperparameter tuning. Existing approaches to AutoML have limitations such as high computational cost, lack of interpretability, and inability to handle complex pipelines. The importance of this problem lies in the fact that manual selection and tuning of machine learning models can be time-consuming and resource-intensive.

### Proposed Method
AutoCompete is an automated machine learning system that uses a pipeline of data preprocessing, feature selection, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning. It differs from prior work by using a transformation pipeline and a model selector that work together to improve the performance of the selected model. The key technical components include the Dataset component, which receives and preprocesses data.

### Key Contributions
AutoCompete uses a transformation pipeline that is integrated with the model selector and hyperparameter tuner. AutoCompete also introduces a strategy for selection of models and tuning hyperparameters that involves sending the selected features and the transformation pipeline through the modelselector andhyperparameter selector.

### Results / Evaluation
The paper reports results on several datasets, including the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset, the Ionosphere dataset, and the Wine dataset. The metrics used for evaluation include accuracy, F1 score, and execution time. AutoCompete is shown to outperform several baseline methods, including Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and Gradient Boosting Decision Tree.

### Limitations
The acknowledged limitations of AutoCompete include the high computational cost of the transformation pipeline and the potential for overfitting if the validation set is not large enough. Potential weaknesses of the approach include the lack of interpretability of the transformed model. The potential for the model selector to get stuck in a local optimum.

## Notes
### Components of AutoCompete 🏗️
The dataset is first preprocessed, then feature engineered, and finally model selected and evaluated. The framework is flexible and can be customized to explore different pipelines and preprocessing steps. It is scalable and can handle large datasets, making it suitable for use in Kaggle-style competitions. It supports parallel processing, allowing multiple models to be trained and evaluated simultaneously, reducing the overall training time. It can be integrated with cloud services like AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure, allowing users to run their experiments on powerful resources.

## Notes
### Problem / Motivation 🚗
Existing AutoML systems require significant manual intervention for building accurate predictive models. Manual hyperparameter tuning is time-consuming and labor-intensive, taking up to 40-60 hours per competition. Current tools like Hyperopt explore unnecessarily large search spaces, leading to inefficient model selection. Current approaches fail because: They don't consider competition-specific constraints, and they don't take into account competition- specific search terms. They also don't explore competition- Specific search terms, which can lead to poor model selection and poor predictive results. For more information on AutoML, visit AutoML.org.
