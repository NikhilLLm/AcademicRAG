The action of quantum measurement, leading the superposition state\nof the measured quantum system into a definite output state, not only\nreconciles contradictions between quantum and classical mechanics but also\nfacilitates quantum state manipulations, including reading and resetting.\nDespite its significance, four fundamental issues -- randomness,\ninstantaneousness, irreversibility, and preferred-basis -- continue to pose\nsignificant challenges to the broader application of quantum measurement and\nour overall understanding of quantum mechanics. In this work, we employ a new\nspace-time approach to relativistic quantum mechanics to address these issues\nsystematically. Our approach provides a comprehensive elucidation of the\nintricate connections between quantum measurement and quantum unitary\nevolution, as well as an in-depth analysis for the interdependence of non-local\ncorrelations and relativistic theories. We thereby reveal a more fundamental\ndynamical theory, beyond the traditional time-evolution equation in quantum\nmechanics, where the axioms of quantum measurement naturally emerge as a\ncorollary. These findings contribute to the advancement of related fields, and\nour work holds potential implications for future research and applications in\nthe realm of quantum mechanics.",

In the first\npart of this paper, I will review a set of techniques of quantum measurement\ntheory that are often used to analyze quantum optomechanical systems. Some of\nthese techniques were originally designed to analyze how a classical driving\nforce passes through a quantum system, and can eventually be detected with\noptimal signal-to-noise ratio --- while others focus more on the quantum state\nevolution of a mechanical object under continuous monitoring. In the second\npart of this paper, I will review a set of experimental concepts that will\ndemonstrate quantum mechanical behavior of macroscopic objects --- quantum\nentanglement, quantum teleportation, and the quantum Zeno effect. Taking the\ninterplay between gravity and quantum mechanics as an example, I will review a\nset of speculations on how quantum mechanics can be modified for macroscopic\nobjects, and how these speculations --- and their generalizations --- might be\ntested by optomechanics.",
