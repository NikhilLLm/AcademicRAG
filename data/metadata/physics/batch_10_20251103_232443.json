We catagorize words into various disciplines of\nastrophysics and find that multimessenger astronomy is promoted the most, both\nin Swift's total discography and throughout the Eras tour.

It is\nshown that in astrophysical environments electromagnetic interactions of the\nneutrino millicharge with strong electromagnetic fields as well as weak\ninteractions of the neutrinos with dense background matter can produce new\nphenomena accessible for astrophysical observations. On this basis a new limit\non the neutrino millicharge $q_0<1.3\\times10^{-19}e_0$ is obtained. This limit\nis among the strongest astrophysical constraint on the neutrino millicharge.\nSome other possible applications of the obtained results to astrophysics are\ndiscussed in details.",
