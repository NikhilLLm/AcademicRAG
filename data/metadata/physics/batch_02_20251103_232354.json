    "abstract": "A necessary and natural change in our application of quantum mechanics to\nseparated systems is shown to reconcile quantum mechanics and local realism. An\nanalysis of separation and localization justifies the proposed change in\napplication of quantum mechanics. An important EPRB experiment is reconsidered\nand it is seen that when it is correctly interpreted it supports local realism.\nThis reconciliation of quantum mechanics with local realism allows the axiom\nsets of quantum mechanics, probability, and special relativity to be joined in\na consistent global axiom set for physics.",

    "title": "Optimal Mechanisms for Quantum Local Differential Privacy",
    "abstract": "Centralized differential privacy has been successfully applied to quantum\ncomputing and information processing to protect privacy and avoid leaks in the\nconnections between neighboring quantum states. Consequently, quantum local\ndifferential privacy (QLDP) has been newly proposed to preserve quantum data\nprivacy akin to the classical scenario where all states are viewed as\nneighboring states. However, the exploration of the QLDP framework is still in\nits early stages, primarily conceptual, which poses challenges for its\npractical implementation in safeguarding quantum state privacy.\n  This paper delves into optimal QLDP mechanisms to balance privacy and utility\nto enhance the practical use of the QLDP framework. QLDP utilizes a parameter\n$\\epsilon$ to manage privacy leaks and ensure the privacy of individual quantum\nstates. The optimization of the QLDP value $\\epsilon$, denoted as $\\epsilon^*$,\nfor any quantum mechanism is addressed as an optimization problem. The\nintroduction of quantum noise is shown to provide privacy protections similar\nto classical scenarios, with quantum depolarizing noise identified as the\noptimal unital privatization mechanism within the QLDP framework. Unital\nmechanisms represent a diverse set of quantum mechanisms that encompass\nfrequently employed quantum noise types. Quantum depolarizing noise optimizes\nboth fidelity and trace distance utilities, which are crucial metrics in the\nfield of quantum computation and information, and can be viewed as a quantum\ncounterpart to classical randomized response methods. The study further\nexplores the trade-off between utility and privacy across different quantum\nnoise mechanisms, including unital and non-unital quantum noise mechanisms,\nthrough both analytical and numerically experimental approaches. This\nhighlights the optimization of quantum depolarizing noise in the QLDP\nframework.",
