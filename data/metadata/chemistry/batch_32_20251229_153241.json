    "title": "Reliable LC-MS/MS-based method for trace level determination of 50 medium to highly polar pesticide residues in sediments and ecological risk assessment",
    "abstract": "The occurrence of polar pesticides in sediments has not been extensively investigated because of their relatively poor hydrophobicity and apparently less persistence in the environment. However, their continuous release into the aquatic systems calls for the evaluation of their potential accumulation in sediments and the role of this matrix as a potential source of these compounds. Considering this, a method based on pressurized liquid extraction (PLE), extract clean-up by solid phase extraction (SPE) and analyte determination by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was developed and validated to analyze 50 relevant (frequently used and/or regulated or found in water) medium to highly polar pesticides in sediments. The method showed good performance regarding accuracy (relative recoveries between 76% and 124%), precision (relative standard deviation values <20%), sensitivity (LODs in the low ng/g for most compounds), linearity (coefficients of determination >0.99), and matrix effects (negligible for all analytes). The use of an isotope dilution approach for quantification ensures results reliability. As a part of the validation process, the method was applied to the analysis of the target pesticides in sediments from the Llobregat River (NE Spain) showing the presence of five of them, namely, terbutryn, dichlorvos, terbuthylazine, diazinon, and irgarol. All 5 pesticides, due to both the concentrations found and their physical-chemical characteristics, demonstrate high potential for bioaccumulation and risk to the aquatic organisms. Additional multidisciplinary studies that investigate pesticides occurrence in the different aquatic compartments and evaluate the potential risks for aquatic ecosystems are required to assess the environmental impact and significance of the presence of pesticides in sediments.",

    "title": "An analytical effective excess charge density model to predict the streaming potential generated by unsaturated flow",
    "abstract": "The self-potential (SP) method is a passive geophysical method that relies on the measurement of naturally occurring electrical field. One of the contributions to the SP signal is the streaming potential, which is of particular interest in hydrogeophysics as it is directly related to both the water flow and porous medium properties. The streaming current is generated by the relative displacement of an excess of electrical charges located in the electrical double layer surrounding the minerals of the porous media. In this study, we develop a physically based analytical model to estimate the effective excess charge density dragged by the water flow under partially saturated conditions. The proposed model is based on the assumption that the porous media can be represented by a bundle of tortuous capillary tubes with a fractal pore size distribution. The excess charge that is effectively dragged by the water flow is estimated using a flux averaging approach. Under these hypotheses, this new model describes the effective excess charge density as a function of saturation and relative permeability while also depending on the chemical and interface properties, and on petrophysical parameters of the media. The expression of the model has an analytical single closed-form which is consistent with a previous model developed from a different approach. The performance of the proposed model is then tested against previous models and different sets of laboratory and field data from the literature. The predictions of the proposed model fits fairly well the experimental data and shows improvements to estimate the magnitude of the effective excess charge density over the previous models. This new model proposes a simple and efficient way to model the streaming current generation for partially saturated porous media.",
