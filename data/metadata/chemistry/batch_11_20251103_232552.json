One of the most puzzling challenges is to\nreconcile physics and chemistry, where molecular physics meets condensed-matter\nphysics, resulting from the scaling effect and dynamic fluctuation of glassy\nmatter at the glass transition temperature. Pioneer of condensed-matter\nphysics, the Nobel Prize-winning physicist Philip Warren Anderson, wrote in\n1995: The deepest and most interesting unsolved problem in condensed-matter\nphysics is probably the theory of the nature of glassy state and the glass\ntransition. In 2005, the question of 'what is the nature of glassy state' was\nsuggested as one of the greatest scientific conundrums over the next\nquarter-century for Science's 125th anniversary. However, the nature of glassy\nstate and its connection to the glass transition have not been fully understood\nowing to the interdisciplinary complexity of physics and chemistry, where they\nare governed by the physical laws at condensed-matter and molecular scales,\nrespectively.

From a historical\nperspective, this evolution is remarkably interesting, particularly when the\nscarce applications of Madelung's former hydrodynamical formulation, dating\nback to the late 1960s and the 1970s, are compared with the many different\napplications available at present. As also happens with classical\nmethodologies, Bohmian trajectories are essentially used to described and\nanalyze the evolution of chemical systems, to design and implement new\ncomputational propagation techniques, or a combination of both. In the first\ncase, Bohmian trajectories have the advantage that they avoid invoking typical\nquantum-classical correspondence to interpret the corresponding phenomenon or\nprocess, while in the second case quantum-mechanical effects appear by\nthemselves, without the necessity to include artificially quantization\nconditions. Rather than providing an exhaustive revision and analysis of all\nthese applications (excellent monographs on the issue are available in the\nliterature for the interested reader, which can be consulted in the\nbibliography here supplied), this Chapter has been prepared in a way that it\nmay serve the reader to acquire a general view (or impression) on how Bohmian\nmechanics has permeated the different traditional levels or pathways to\napproach molecular systems in Chemistry: electronic structure, molecular\ndynamics and statistical mechanics.

The\nmethod is designed to eliminate the problems inherent in the rate-equation\nformalism to surface chemistry. Here we report the first use of this method in\na chemical model of cold interstellar cloud cores that includes both gas-phase\nand surface chemistry. The surface chemical network consists of a small number\nof diffusive reactions that can produce molecular oxygen, water, carbon\ndioxide, formaldehyde, methanol and assorted radicals. METHOD: The simulation\nis started by running a gas-phase model including accretion onto grains but no\nsurface chemistry or evaporation. The starting surface consists of either flat\nor rough olivine. We introduce the surface chemistry of the three species H, O\nand CO in an iterative manner using our stochastic technique. Under the\nconditions of the simulation, only atomic hydrogen can evaporate to a\nsignificant extent. Although it has little effect on other gas-phase species,\nthe evaporation of atomic hydrogen changes its gas-phase abundance, which in\nturn changes the flux of atomic hydrogen onto grains. The effect on the surface\nchemistry is treated until convergence occurs. We neglect all non-thermal\ndesorptive processes. RESULTS: We determine the mantle abundances of assorted\nmolecules as a function of time through 2x10^5 yr. Our method also allows\ndetermination of the abundance of each molecule in specific monolayers. The\nmantle results can be compared with observations of water, carbon dioxide,\ncarbon monoxide, and methanol ices in the sources W33A and Elias 16. Other than\na slight underproduction of mantle CO, our results are in very good agreement\nwith observations.",

The main\nfocus has always been the desire to be able to treat ever larger molecules or\nmolecular assemblies---especially linear and sub-linear scaling techniques are\ndevoted to the accomplishment of this goal. However, as many chemical reactions\nare rather local, they usually involve only a limited number of atoms so that\nmodels of about two hundred (or even less) atoms embedded in a suitable\nenvironment are sufficient to study their mechanisms. Thus, the system size\ndoes not need to be enlarged, but remains constant for reactions of this type\nthat can be described by less than two hundred atoms. The question then arises\nhow fast one can obtain the quantum chemical results. This question is not\ndirectly answered by linear-scaling techniques. In fact, ideas such as haptic\nquantum chemistry or interactive quantum chemistry require an immediate\nprovision of quantum chemical information which demands the calculation of data\nin \"real time\". In this perspective, we aim at a definition of real-time\nquantum chemistry, explore its realm and eventually discuss applications in the\nfield of haptic quantum chemistry. For the latter we elaborate whether a direct\napproach is possible by virtue of real-time quantum chemistry.",

We make these measurements for representative photochemical\nreactions involving SO$_3^{2-}$ and HS$^-$.

However, it is well-known that the calculated\nharmonic frequencies tend to systematically overestimate experimental\nfundamental frequencies; a limitation commonly overcome with multiplicative\nscaling factors.\n  In practice, multiplicative scaling factors are derived for each individual\nmodel chemistry choice (i.e., a level of theory and basis set pair), where\nperformance is judged by, for example, the root-mean square error (RMSE)\nbetween the predicted scaled and experimental frequencies. However, despite the\noverwhelming number of scaling factors reported in the literature and model\nchemistry approximations available, there is little guidance for users on\nappropriate model chemistry choices for harmonic frequency calculations.\n  Here, we compile and analyse the data for 1495 scaling factors calculated\nusing 141 levels of theory and 109 basis sets. Our meta-analysis of this data\nshows that scaling factors and RMSE approach convergence with only hybrid\nfunctionals and double-zeta basis sets, with anharmonicity error already\ndominating model chemistry errors. Noting inconsistent data and the lack of\nindependent testing, we can nevertheless conclude that a minimum error of\n25cm-1 -- arising from insufficiently accurate treatment of anharmonicity -- is\npersistent regardless of the model chemistry choice.

However, the\napproach ignores disequilibrium chemistry in most current retrieval codes,\nwhich can lead to misinterpretation of the metallicity or elemental abundance\nratios of the atmosphere. We have implemented the disequilibrium effect of\nvertical mixing or quenching for the major species in hydrogen/helium-dominated\natmospheres, namely $\\mathrm{CH_4}$, $\\mathrm{CO}$, $\\mathrm{H_2O}$,\n$\\mathrm{NH_3}$, $\\mathrm{N_2}$, and $\\mathrm{CO_2}$, for the spectral\nretrieval code ARCiS with a physical basis using the chemical relaxation\nmethod. Then, using ARCiS updated with this module, we have performed\nretrievals of the observed transmission spectra of 16 exoplanets with sizes\nranging from Jupiter to mini-Neptune. As a result, we find indications of\ndisequilibrium chemistry for HD 209458b ($\\geq 4.1\\sigma$) and WASP-39b ($\\geq\n2.7\\sigma$). The retrieved spectrum of HD 209458b exhibits a strong\n$\\mathrm{NH_3}$ absorption feature at 10.5 $\\mu$m accessible by JWST owing to\nan enhanced abundance of $\\mathrm{NH_3}$ due to the quenching effect. This\nfeature is absent in the spectrum retrieved assuming equilibrium chemistry,\nwhich makes HD 209458b an ideal target for studying disequilibrium chemistry in\nexoplanet atmospheres. Moreover, for HAT-P-11b and GJ 436b, we obtain\nrelatively different results than for the retrieval with the equilibrium\nassumption, such as a $2.9\\sigma$ difference for the C/O ratio.

    "title": "The Chemistry of Dark Clouds: New Astrochemical Tools for Star Formation\n  Studies",
    "abstract": "The past decade has led to significant improvements in our understanding of\nthe physical structure of the molecular cores of cold dark clouds.\nObservational efforts, in combination with improved knowledge of cloud\nstructure, now provide clear evidence that the chemistry of dark clouds is\ndominated by the depletion of gaseous species onto grain surfaces. We outline\nthe basis of these observational efforts and show how the abundance\ndeterminations have moved beyond single point analyses to the derivation of\nabundance profiles. We discuss the basic physics of the interaction between\nmolecules and grain surfaces and show that when physics is coupled into a\nchemical model there is excellent agreement, for a limited set of species,\nbetween theory and observations. We discuss our improved understanding of cloud\nchemistry can be used as a new tool for studies of the formation of stars and\nplanetary systems.",

    "title": "Computational Chemistry as Voodoo Quantum Mechanics : Models,\n  Parameterization, and Software",
    "abstract": "Computational chemistry grew in a new era of \"desktop modeling\", which\ncoincided with a growing demand for modeling software, especially from the\npharmaceutical industry. Parameterization of models in computational chemistry\nis an arduous enterprise, and we argue that this activity leads, in this\nspecific context, to tensions among scientists regarding the lack of epistemic\ntransparency of parameterized methods and the software implementing them. To\nexplicit these tensions, we rely on a corpus which is suited for revealing\nthem, namely the Computational Chemistry mailing List (CCL), a professional\nscientific discussion forum. We relate one flame war from this corpus in order\nto assess in detail the relationships between modeling methods,\nparameterization, software and the various forms of their enclosure or\ndisclosure. Our claim is that parameterization issues are a source of epistemic\nopacity and that this opacity is entangled in methods and software alike.\nModels and software must be addressed together to understand the\nepistemological tensions at stake.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning models are poised to make a transformative impact on\nchemical sciences by dramatically accelerating computational algorithms and\namplifying insights available from computational chemistry methods. However,\nachieving this requires a confluence and coaction of expertise in computer\nscience and physical sciences. This review is written for new and experienced\nresearchers working at the intersection of both fields. We first provide\nconcise tutorials of computational chemistry and machine learning methods,\nshowing how insights involving both can be achieved. We then follow with a\ncritical review of noteworthy applications that demonstrate how computational\nchemistry and machine learning can be used together to provide insightful (and\nuseful) predictions in molecular and materials modeling, retrosyntheses,\ncatalysis, and drug design.",
