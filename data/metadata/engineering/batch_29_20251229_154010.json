    "title": "An Approximate Feasibility Assessment of Electric Vehicles Adoption in Nigeria: Forecast 2030",
    "abstract": "Efforts toward building a sustainable future have underscored the importance of collective responsibility among state and non-state actors, corporations, and individuals to achieve climate goals. International initiatives, including the Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement, emphasize the need for immediate action from all stakeholders. This paper presents a feasibility assessment focused on the opportunities within Nigeria's Electric Vehicle Value Chain, aiming to enhance public understanding of the country's renewable energy sector. As petroleum currently fulfills over 95% of global transportation needs, energy companies must diversify their portfolios and integrate various renewable energy sources to transition toward a sustainable future. The shifting investor sentiment away from traditional fossil fuel industries further highlights the imperative of incorporating renewables. To facilitate significant progress in the renewable energy sector, it is vital to establish platforms that support the growth and diversification of industry players, with knowledge sharing playing a pivotal role. This feasibility assessment serves as an initial reference for individuals and businesses seeking technically and economically viable opportunities within the sector.",

    "title": "Agentic AI Systems in Electrical Power Systems Engineering: Current State-of-the-Art and Challenges",
    "abstract": "Agentic AI systems have recently emerged as a critical and transformative approach in artificial intelligence, offering capabilities that extend far beyond traditional AI agents and contemporary generative AI models. This rapid evolution necessitates a clear conceptual and taxonomical understanding to differentiate this new paradigm. Our paper addresses this gap by providing a comprehensive review that establishes a precise definition and taxonomy for \"agentic AI,\" with the aim of distinguishing it from previous AI paradigms. The concepts are gradually introduced, starting with a highlight of its diverse applications across the broader field of engineering. The paper then presents four detailed, state-of-the-art use case applications specifically within electrical engineering. These case studies demonstrate practical impact, ranging from an advanced agentic framework for streamlining complex power system studies and benchmarking to a novel system developed for survival analysis of dynamic pricing strategies in battery swapping stations. Finally, to ensure robust deployment, the paper provides detailed failure mode investigations. From these findings, we derive actionable recommendations for the design and implementation of safe, reliable, and accountable agentic AI systems, offering a critical resource for researchers and practitioners.",

    "title": "Electric Energy Storage Systems integration in Distribution Grids",
    "abstract": "This paper presents a real time control strategy for dynamically balancing electric demand and supply at local level, in a scenario characterized by a HV/MV substation with the presence of renewable energy sources in the form of photovoltaic generators and an electric energy storage system. The substation is connected to the grid and is powered by an equivalent traditional power plant playing the role of the bulk power system. A Model Predictive Control based approach is proposed, by which the active power setpoints for the traditional power plant and the storage are continually updated over the time, depending on generation costs, storage's state of charge, foreseen demand and production from renewables. The proposed approach is validated on a simulation basis, showing its effectiveness in managing fluctuations of network demand and photovoltaic generation in test and real conditions.",

    "title": "Electricity generation from renewable energy based on abandoned wind fan",
    "abstract": "In the 21st century, our world is facing difficult conditions for serious environmental pollution and the problem of energy shortage. An innovative idea has emerged to recycle wind energy from air conditioning condenser fans in outdoor buildings. Therefore, the main goal of this research is to develop renewable wind energy from the condenser fan of an air conditioner using Arduino as a microcontroller. This research moves towards a portable, low cost, environmentally friendly mini device that harnesses renewable energies with endless resources for future alternative power generation and reduces the burden of consumers' electricity bills",

    "title": "Integrated Optimization of Power Split, Engine Thermal Management, and Cabin Heating for Hybrid Electric Vehicles",
    "abstract": "Cabin heating demand and engine efficiency degradation in cold weather lead to considerable increase in fuel consumption of hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), especially in congested traffic conditions. This paper presents an integrated power and thermal management (i-PTM) scheme for the optimization of power split, engine thermal management, and cabin heating of HEVs. A control-oriented model of a power split HEV, including power and thermal loops, is developed and experimentally validated against data collected from a 2017 Toyota Prius HEV. Based on this model, the dynamic programming (DP) technique is adopted to derive a bench-mark for minimal fuel consumption, using 2-dimensional (power split and engine thermal management) and 3-dimensional (power split, engine thermal management, and cabin heating) formulations. Simulation results for a real-world congested driving cycle show that the engine thermal effect and the cabin heating requirement can significantly influence the optimal behavior for the power management, and substantial potential on fuel saving can be achieved by the i-PTM optimization as compared to conventional power and thermal management strategies.",
