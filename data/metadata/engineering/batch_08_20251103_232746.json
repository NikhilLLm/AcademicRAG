    "abstract": "We propose a concept of magnetic logic circuits engineering, which takes an\nadvantage of magnetization as a computational state variable and exploits spin\nwaves for information transmission. The circuits consist of magneto-electric\ncells connected via spin wave buses. We present the result of numerical\nmodeling showing the magneto-electric cell switching as a function of the\namplitude as well as the phase of the spin wave. The phase-dependent switching\nmakes it possible to engineer logic gates by exploiting spin wave buses as\npassive logic elements providing a certain phase-shift to the propagating spin\nwaves. We present a library of logic gates consisting of magneto-electric cells\nand spin wave buses providing 0 or p phase shifts. The utilization of phases in\naddition to amplitudes is a powerful tool which let us construct logic circuits\nwith a fewer number of elements than required for CMOS technology. As an\nexample, we present the design of the magnonic Full Adder Circuit comprising\nonly 5 magneto-electric cells. The proposed concept may provide a route to more\nfunctional wave-based logic circuitry with capabilities far beyond the limits\nof the traditional transistor-based approach.",

    "abstract": "This article describes a method called Lorentz Force Electrical Impedance\nTomography. The electrical conductivity of biological tissues can be measured\nthrough their sonication in a magnetic field: the vibration of the tissues\ninside the field induces an electrical current by Lorentz force. This current,\ndetected by electrodes placed around the sample, is proportional to the\nultrasonic pressure, to the strength of the magnetic field and to the\nelectrical conductivity gradient along the acoustic axis. By focusing at\ndifferent places inside the sample, a map of the electrical conductivity\ngradient can be established. In this study experiments were conducted on a\ngelatin phantom and on a beef sample, successively placed in a 300 mT magnetic\nfield and sonicated with an ultrasonic transducer focused at 21 cm emitting 500\nkHz bursts. Although all interfaces are not visible, in this exploratory study\na good correlation is observed between the electrical conductivity image and\nthe ultrasonic image. This method offers an alternative to detecting\npathologies invisible to standard ultrasonography.",

La0.67Sr0.33MnO3 is a key example of a strongly correlated\nperoskite oxide material in which a subtle balance of competing interactions\ngives rise to a ferromagnetic metallic groundstate. This balance, however, is\neasily disrupted at interfaces. We systematically vary the dopant profile, the\ndisorder and the oxygen octahedra rotations at the interface to investigate\nwhich mechanism is responsible for the dead layer. We find that the magnetic\ndead layer can be completely eliminated by compositional interface engineering\nsuch that the polar discontinuity at the interface is removed.

This study investigates the\nap-plication of RAG for ABB circuit breakers, focusing on accuracy,\nreliability, and contextual relevance in high-stakes engineering environments.\nBy leveraging tailored datasets, advanced embedding models, and optimized\nchunking strategies, the research addresses challenges in data retrieval and\ncontextual alignment unique to engineering documentation. Key contributions\ninclude the development of a domain-specific dataset for ABB circuit breakers\nand the evaluation of three RAG pipelines: OpenAI GPT4o, Cohere, and Anthropic\nClaude. Advanced chunking methods, such as paragraph-based and title-aware\nsegmentation, are assessed for their impact on retrieval accuracy and response\ngeneration. Results demonstrate that while certain configurations achieve high\nprecision and relevancy, limitations persist in ensuring factual faithfulness\nand completeness, critical in engineering contexts. This work underscores the\nneed for iterative improvements in RAG systems to meet the stringent demands of\nelectrical engineering tasks, including design, troubleshooting, and\noperational decision-making. The findings in this paper help advance research\nof AI in highly technical domains such as electrical engineering.",

    "abstract": "Strongly-coupled quantum dot molecules (QDMs) are widely deployed in the\ndesign of a variety of optoelectronic, photovoltaic, and quantum information\ndevices. An efficient and optimized performance of these devices demands\nengineering of the electronic and optical properties of the underlying QDMs.\nThe application of electric fields offers a knob to realise such control over\nthe QDM characteristics for a desired device operation. We perform\nmulti-million-atom atomistic tight-binding calculations to study the influence\nof electric fields on the electron and hole wave function confinements and\nsymmetries, the ground-state transition energies, the band-gap wavelengths, and\nthe optical transition modes. The electrical fields both parallel ($\\vec{E_p}$)\nand anti-parallel ($\\vec{E_a}$) to the growth direction are investigated to\nprovide a comprehensive guide on the understanding of the electric field\neffects. The strain-induced asymmetry of the hybridized electron states is\nfound to be weak and can be balanced by applying a small $\\vec{E_a}$ electric\nfield, of the order of 1 KV/cm. The strong interdot couplings completely break\ndown at large electric fields, leading to single QD states confined at the\nopposite edges of the QDM. This mimics a transformation from a type-I band\nstructure to a type-II band structure for the QDMs, which is a critical\nrequirement for the design of intermediate-band solar cells (IBSC). The\nanalysis of the field-dependent ground-state transition energies reveal that\nthe QDM can be operated both as a high dipole moment device by applying large\nelectric fields and as a high polarizibility device under the application of\nsmall electric field magnitudes.

We address three important issues\npertaining to EV charging and integration into the power system: (1) charging\nstation placement, (2) pricing policy and energy management strategy, and (3)\nelectricity trading market and distribution network design to facilitate\nintegrating EV and renewable energy source (RES) into the power system.\n  For charging station placement problem, we propose a multi-stage consumer\nbehavior based placement strategy with incremental EV penetration rates and\nmodel the EV charging industry as an oligopoly where the entire market is\ndominated by a few charging service providers (oligopolists). The optimal\nplacement policy for each service provider is obtained by solving a Bayesian\ngame.\n  For pricing and energy management of EV charging stations, we provide\nguidelines for charging service providers to determine charging price and\nmanage electricity reserve to balance the competing objectives of improving\nprofitability, enhancing customer satisfaction, and reducing impact on the\npower system. Two algorithms --- stochastic dynamic programming (SDP) algorithm\nand greedy algorithm (benchmark algorithm) are applied to derive the pricing\nand electricity procurement strategy.\n  We design a novel electricity trading market and distribution network, which\nsupports seamless RES integration, grid to vehicle (G2V), vehicle to grid\n(V2G), vehicle to vehicle (V2V), and distributed generation (DG) and storage.\nWe apply a sharing economy model to the electricity sector to stimulate\ndifferent entities to exchange and monetize their underutilized electricity.

The fuzzy logic decision-making process governs\nthe vehicle control system. The performance was assessed under various driving\nconditions. Key findings include a significant enhancement in pure electric\nmode efficiency, achieving an extended full-electric range of approximately 84\nkilometers on an 80% utilization of a 20-kWh battery pack. During the WLTC\ndriving cycle, the control system reduced fuel consumption to 2.86 L/100km,\nrepresenting a 20% reduction in gasoline-equivalent fuel consumption.\nEvaluations of vehicle performance at discrete driving speeds, highlighted\neffective energy management, with the vehicle battery charging at lower speeds\nand discharging at higher speeds, showing optimized energy recovery and\nconsumption strategies. Initial battery charge levels notably influenced\nvehicle performance. A 90% initial charge enabled prolonged all-electric\noperation, minimizing fuel consumption to 2 L/100km less than that of the base\ncontrol system. Real-world driving pattern analysis revealed significant\nvariations, with shorter, slower cycles requiring lower fuel consumption due to\nprioritized electric propulsion, while longer, faster cycles increased internal\ncombustion engine usage. The control system also adapted to different battery\nstate of health (SOH) conditions, with higher SOH facilitating extended\nelectric mode usage, reducing total fuel consumption by up to 2.87 L/100km.",

    "title": "A Novel Approach for Optimal Trajectory Design with Multiple Operation\n  Modes of Propulsion System, Part 2",
    "abstract": "Equipping a spacecraft with multiple solar-powered electric engines (of the\nsame or different types) compounds the task of optimal trajectory design due to\npresence of both real-valued inputs (power input to each engine in addition to\nthe direction of thrust vector) and discrete variables (number of active\nengines). Each engine can be switched on/off independently and \"optimal\"\noperating power of each engine depends on the available solar power, which\ndepends on the distance from the Sun. Application of the Composite Smooth\nControl (CSC) framework to a heliocentric fuel-optimal trajectory optimization\nfrom the Earth to the comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko is demonstrated, which\npresents a new approach to deal with multiple-engine problems. Operation of\nengine clusters with 4, 6, 10 and even 20 engines of the same type can be\noptimized. Moreover, engine clusters with different/mixed electric engines are\nconsidered with either 2, 3 or 4 different types of engines. Remarkably, the\nCSC framework allows us 1) to reduce the original multi-point boundary-value\nproblem to a two-point boundary-value problem (TPBVP), and 2) to solve the\nresulting TPBVPs using a single-shooting solution scheme and with a random\ninitialization of the missing costates. While the approach we present is a\ncontinuous neighbor of the discontinuous extremals, we show that the\ndiscontinuous necessary conditions are satisfied in the asymptotic limit. We\nbelieve this is the first indirect method to accommodate a multi-mode control\nof this level of complexity with realistic engine performance curves. The\nresults are interesting and promising for dealing with a large family of such\nchallenging multi-mode optimal control problems.",

In this paper we report an experimental study of\na metasurface capable of providing electrical and magnetic resonant SHG\nenhancement for TM polarization. Our metasurface could be engineered such that\nthe peak frequencies of electrical and magnetic resonances could be adjusted\nindependently. We used this feature to distinguish their relative\ncontributions.

    "abstract": "Electrical heat engines driven by the Johnson-Nyquist noise of resistors are\nintroduced. They utilize Coulomb's law and the fluctuation-dissipation theorem\nof statistical physics that is the reverse phenomenon of heat dissipation in a\nresistor. No steams, gases, liquids, photons, combustion, phase transition, or\nexhaust/pollution are present here. In these engines, instead of heat\nreservoirs, cylinders, pistons and valves, resistors, capacitors and switches\nare the building elements. For the best performance, a large number of parallel\nengines must be integrated to run in a synchronized fashion and the\ncharacteristic size of the elementary engine must be at the 10 nanometers\nscale. At room temperature, in the most idealistic case, a two-dimensional\nensemble of engines of 25 nanometer characteristic size integrated on a 2.5x2.5\ncm silicon wafer with 12 Celsius temperature difference between the warm-source\nand the cold-sink would produce a specific power of about 0.4 Watt. Regular and\ncoherent (correlated-cylinder states) versions are shown and both of them can\nwork in either four-stroke or two-stroke modes. The coherent engines have\nproperties that correspond to coherent quantum heat engines without the\npresence of quantum coherence. In the idealistic case, all these engines have\nCarnot efficiency, which is the highest possible efficiency of any heat engine,\nwithout violating the second law of thermodynamics.",

    "abstract": "We present an in-depth analysis of the sometimes understated role of the\nprinciple of energy conservation in linear irreversible thermodynamics. Our\ncase study is that of a thermoelectric generator (TEG), which is a heat engine\nof choice in irreversible thermodynamics, owing to the coupling between the\nelectrical and heat fluxes. We show why Onsager's reciprocal relations must be\nconsidered locally and how internal dissipative processes emerge from the\nextension of these relations to a global scale: the linear behavior of a heat\nengine at the local scale is associated with a dissipation process that must\npartake in the global energy balance. We discuss the consequences of internal\ndissipations on the so-called efficiency at maximum power, in the light of our\ncomparative analyses of exoreversibility and endoreversibility on the one hand,\nand of two classes of heat engines, autonomous and periodically-driven, on the\nother hand. Finally, basing our analysis on energy conservation, we also\ndiscuss recent works which claim the possibility to overcome the traditional\nboundaries on efficiency imposed by finite-time thermodynamics in\nthermoelectric systems with broken time-reversal symmetry; this we do by\nintroducing a \"thermal\" thermopower and an \"electrical\" thermopower which\npermits an analysis of the thermoelectric response of the TEG considering a\npossible dissymmetry between the electrical/thermal and the thermal/electrical\ncouplings.",

    "abstract": "Engineering the local density of states with nanophotonic structures is a\npowerful tool to control light-matter interactions via the Purcell effect. At\noptical frequencies, control over the electric field density of states is\ntypically used to couple to and manipulate electric dipole transitions.\nHowever, it is also possible to engineer the magnetic density of states to\ncontrol magnetic dipole transitions. In this work, we experimentally\ndemonstrate the optical magnetic Purcell effect using a single rare earth ion\ncoupled to a nanophotonic cavity. We engineer a new single photon emitter,\nEr$^{3+}$ in MgO, where the electric dipole decay rate is strongly suppressed\nby the cubic site symmetry, giving rise to a nearly pure magnetic dipole\noptical transition. This allows the unambiguous determination of a magnetic\nPurcell factor $P_m=1040 \\pm 30$. We further extend this technique to realize a\nmagnetic dipole spin-photon interface, performing optical spin initialization\nand readout of a single Er$^{3+}$ electron spin. This work demonstrates the\nfundamental equivalence of electric and magnetic density of states engineering,\nand provides a new tool for controlling light-matter interactions for a broader\nclass of emitters.",

    "abstract": "Nanoscale electrostatic control of oxide interfaces enables physical\nphenomena and exotic functionalities beyond the realm of the bulk material. In\ntechnologically-relevant ferroelectric thin films, the interface-mediated\npolarization control is usually exerted by engineering the depolarizing field.\nHere, in contrast, we introduce polarizing surfaces and lattice chemistry\nengineering as an alternative strategy. Specifically, we engineer the\nelectric-dipole ordering in ferroelectric oxide heterostructures by exploiting\nthe charged sheets of the layered Aurivillius model system. By tracking in-situ\nthe formation of the Aurivillius charged Bi$_{2}$O$_{2}$ sheets, we reveal\ntheir polarizing effect leading to the characteristic Aurivillius out-of-plane\nantipolar ordering. Next, we use the polarizing Bi$_{2}$O$_{2}$ stacking as a\nversatile electrostatic environment to create new electric dipole\nconfigurations. We insert multiferroic BiFeO$_3$ into the Aurivillius framework\nto stabilize a ferrielectric-like non-collinear electric-dipole order in the\nfinal heterostructure while maintaining the antiferromagnetic order of\nBiFeO$_3$. We thus demonstrate that engineering the lattice chemistry\nstabilizes unconventional ferroic orderings at the nanoscale, a strategy that\nmay be expanded beyond the realm of electrically ordered materials.",

    "abstract": "Engineering van Hove singularities (vHss) near the Fermi level, if feasible,\noffers a powerful route to control exotic quantum phases in electronic and\nmagnetic behaviors. However, conventional approaches, which rely primarily on\nchemical and electrical doping, focus mainly on local electrical or optical\nmeasurements, limiting their applicability to coupled functionalities. In this\nstudy, a vHs-induced insulator-metal transition coupled with a ferromagnetic\nphase transition was empirically achieved in atomically designed quasi-2D\nSrRuO3 (SRO) superlattices via epitaxial strain engineering, which has not been\nobserved in conventional 3D SRO systems. Theoretical calculations revealed that\nepitaxial strain effectively modulates the strength and energy positions of vHs\nof specific Ru orbitals, driving correlated phase transitions in the electronic\nand magnetic ground states. X-ray absorption spectroscopy confirmed the\nanisotropic electronic structure of quasi-2D SRO modulated by epitaxial strain.\nMagneto-optic Kerr effect and electrical transport measurements demonstrated\nmodulated magnetic and electronic phases. Furthermore, magneto-electrical\nmeasurements detected significant anomalous Hall effect signals and\nferromagnetic magnetoresistance, indicating the presence of magnetically\ncoupled charge carriers in the 2D metallic regime.
