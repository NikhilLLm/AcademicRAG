    "abstract": "Machine learning technologies have demonstrated immense capabilities in\nvarious domains. They play a key role in the success of modern businesses.\nHowever, adoption of machine learning technologies has a lot of untouched\npotential. Cost of developing custom machine learning solutions that solve\nunique business problems is a major inhibitor to far-reaching adoption of\nmachine learning technologies. We recognize that the monolithic nature\nprevalent in today's machine learning applications stands in the way of\nefficient and cost effective customized machine learning solution development.\nIn this work we explore the benefits of modular machine learning solutions and\ndiscuss how modular machine learning solutions can overcome some of the major\nsolution engineering limitations of monolithic machine learning solutions. We\nanalyze the trade-offs between modular and monolithic machine learning\nsolutions through three deep learning problems; one text based and the two\nimage based. Our experimental results show that modular machine learning\nsolutions have a promising potential to reap the solution engineering\nadvantages of modularity while gaining performance and data advantages in a way\nthe monolithic machine learning solutions do not permit.",

    "abstract": "Recently, the use of machine learning in meteorology has increased greatly.\nWhile many machine learning methods are not new, university classes on machine\nlearning are largely unavailable to meteorology students and are not required\nto become a meteorologist. The lack of formal instruction has contributed to\nperception that machine learning methods are 'black boxes' and thus end-users\nare hesitant to apply the machine learning methods in their every day workflow.\nTo reduce the opaqueness of machine learning methods and lower hesitancy\ntowards machine learning in meteorology, this paper provides a survey of some\nof the most common machine learning methods. A familiar meteorological example\nis used to contextualize the machine learning methods while also discussing\nmachine learning topics using plain language. The following machine learning\nmethods are demonstrated: linear regression; logistic regression; decision\ntrees; random forest; gradient boosted decision trees; naive Bayes; and support\nvector machines. Beyond discussing the different methods, the paper also\ncontains discussions on the general machine learning process as well as best\npractices to enable readers to apply machine learning to their own datasets.\nFurthermore, all code (in the form of Jupyter notebooks and Google Colaboratory\nnotebooks) used to make the examples in the paper is provided in an effort to\ncatalyse the use of machine learning in meteorology.",

In this\narticle, our goal is to explain the issue of bias in machine learning from a\ntechnical perspective and to illustrate the impact that biased data can have on\na machine learning model.
