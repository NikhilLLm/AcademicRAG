Its proof theory has been notoriously difficult\nto get right, and existing sequent calculi all involve inference rules with\ncomplex annotations to guarantee soundness and cut-elimination. We give a\nsimple and annotation-free display calculus for FILL which satisfies Belnap's\ngeneric cut-elimination theorem. To do so, our display calculus actually\nhandles an extension of FILL, called Bi-Intuitionistic Linear Logic (BiILL),\nwith an `exclusion' connective defined via an adjunction with par. We refine\nour display calculus for BiILL into a cut-free nested sequent calculus with\ndeep inference in which the explicit structural rules of the display calculus\nbecome admissible. A separation property guarantees that proofs of FILL\nformulae in the deep inference calculus contain no trace of exclusion. Each\nsuch rule is sound for the semantics of FILL, thus our deep inference calculus\nand display calculus are conservative over FILL. The deep inference calculus\nalso enjoys the subformula property and terminating backward proof search,\nwhich gives the NP-completeness of BiILL and FILL.",

These\noperators cannot be elliptic and the relevant pseudodifferential calculus to\nstudy them is provided by the Heisenberg calculus. The aim of this monograph is\nthreefold. First, we give an intrinsic approach to the Heisenberg calculus by\nfinding an intrinsic notion of principal symbol in this setting. This framework\nallows us to prove that the pointwise invertibility of a principal symbol,\nwhich can be restated in terms of the so-called Rockland condition, actually\nimplies its global invertibility. Second, we study complex powers of\nhypoelliptic operators on Heisenberg manifolds in terms of the Heisenberg\ncalculus. In particular, we show that complex powers of such operators give\nrise to holomorphic families in the Heisenberg calculus and we construct a\nscale of weighted Sobolev spaces providing us with sharp estimates for the\noperators in the Heisenberg calculus. Third, we make use of the Heisenberg\ncalculus and of the results of this monograph to derive spectral asymptotics\nfor hypoelliptic operators on Heisenberg manifolds.

Our calculus is truly\nquantitative, i.e. instead of Boolean valued predicates, it manipulates\nreal-valued functions.\n  En route to the $\\textsf{aert}$ calculus, we study the $\\textsf{ert}$\ncalculus for reasoning about expected runtimes of Kaminski et al. [2018]\nextended by capabilities for handling dynamic memory, thus enabling\ncompositional and local reasoning about randomized data structures. This\nextension employs runtime separation logic, which has been foreshadowed by\nMatheja [2020] and then implemented in Isabelle/HOL by Haslbeck [2021]. In\naddition to Haslbeck's results, we further prove soundness of the so-extended\n$\\textsf{ert}$ calculus with respect to an operational Markov decision process\nmodel featuring countably-branching nondeterminism, provide intuitive\nexplanations, and provide proof rules enabling separation logic-style\nverification for upper bounds on expected runtimes. Finally, we build the\nso-called potential method for amortized analysis into the $\\textsf{ert}$\ncalculus, thus obtaining the $\\textsf{aert}$ calculus.\n  Since one needs to be able to handle changes in potential which can be\nnegative, the $\\textsf{aert}$ calculus needs to be capable of handling signed\nrandom variables. A particularly pleasing feature of our solution is that,\nunlike e.g. Kozen [1985], we obtain a loop rule for our signed random\nvariables, and furthermore, unlike e.g. Kaminski and Katoen [2017], the\n$\\textsf{aert}$ calculus makes do without the need for involved technical\nmachinery keeping track of the integrability of the random variables.\n  Finally, we present case studies, including a formal analysis of a randomized\ndelete-insert-find-any set data structure [Brodal et al. 1996].",
