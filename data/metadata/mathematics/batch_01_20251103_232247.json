It\nis a classical result that M_1 is the class of all derived algebras modulo\ntheir centres of affine Kac-Moody Lie algebras. This combined with the\nPeterson-Kac conjugacy theorem for affine algebras results in a classification\nof the algebras in M_1. In this paper, we classify the algebras in M_2, and\nfurther determine the relationship between M_2 and two other classes of Lie\nalgebras: the class of all loop algebras of affine Lie algebras and the class\nof all extended affine Lie algebras of nullity 2.",

The Levi theorem states that every finite dimensional Lie algebra is\nisomorphic to a semidirect sum of its largest solvable ideal and a semisimple\nLie algebra.

One approach towards this task is\nto take a class of nilpotent Lie algebras and construct all extensions of these\nalgebras to solvable ones. In this paper, we propose another approach, i.e., to\ndecompose a solvable nonnilpotent Lie algebra to two nilpotent Lie algebras\nwhich are called the left and right nilpotent algebras of the solvable algebra.\nThe right nilpotent algebra is the smallest ideal of the lower central series\nof the solvable algebra, while the left nilpotent algebra is the factor algebra\nof the solvable algebra and its right nilpotent algebra.

Every Bernstein\nalgebra has a maximal algebraic ideal, and the quotient algebra is a\nzero-multiplication algebra. Several equivalent conditions for a Bernstein\nalgebra to be algebraic are given. In particular, known characterizations of\ntrain Bernstein algebras in terms of nilpotency are generalized to the case of\nlocally train algebras. Along the way, we show that if a Banach Bernstein\nalgebra is algebraic (respectively, locally train), then it is of bounded\ndegree (respectively, train).\n  Then we investigate the Kurosh problem for Bernstein algebras: whether a\nfinitely generated Bernstein algebra which is algebraic of bounded degree is\nfinite-dimensional. This problem turns out to have a closed link with a\nquestion about associative algebras. In particular, when the barideal is nil,\nthe Kurosh problem asks whether a finitely generated Bernstein-train algebra is\nfinite-dimensional. We prove that the answer is positive for some specific\ncases and for low degrees, and construct counter-examples in the general case.\n  By results of Yagzhev, the Jacobian conjecture is equivalent to a certain\nstatement about Engel and nilpotence identities of multioperator algebras. We\nshow that the generalized Jacobian conjecture for quadratic mappings holds for\nBernstein algebras.",
