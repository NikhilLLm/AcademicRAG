    "abstract": "Anti-pre-Lie algebras, Novikov algebras and commutative 2-cocycles on Lie\nalgebrasWe introduce the notion of anti-pre-Lie algebras as the underlying\nalgebraic structures of nondegenerate commutative 2-cocycles which are the\n\"symmetric\" version of symplectic forms on Lie algebras. They can be\ncharacterized as a class of Lie-admissible algebras whose negative left\nmultiplication operators make representations of the commutator Lie algebras.\nWe observe that there is a clear analogy between anti-pre-Lie algebras and\npre-Lie algebras by comparing them in terms of several aspects. Furthermore, it\nis unexpected that a subclass of anti-pre-Lie algebras, namely admissible\nNovikov algebras, correspond to Novikov algebras in terms of $q$-algebras.\nConsequently, there is a construction of admissible Novikov algebras from\ncommutative associative algebras with derivations or more generally, admissible\npairs. The correspondence extends to the level of Poisson type structures,\nleading to the introduction of the notions of anti-pre-Lie Poisson algebras and\nadmissible Novikov-Poisson algebras, whereas the latter correspond to\nNovikov-Poisson algebras.",

More significantly, a transposed Poisson algebra naturally\narises from a Novikov-Poisson algebra by taking the commutator Lie algebra of\nthe Novikov algebra. Consequently, the classic construction of a Poisson\nalgebra from a commutative associative algebra with a pair of commuting\nderivations has a similar construction of a transposed Poisson algebra when\nthere is one derivation. More broadly, the transposed Poisson algebra also\ncaptures the algebraic structures when the commutator is taken in pre-Lie\nPoisson algebras and two other Poisson type algebras. Furthermore, the\ntransposed Poisson algebra improves two processes in~[17] that produce 3-Lie\nalgebras from Poisson algebras with a strongness condition. When transposed\nPoisson algebras are used in one process, the strongness condition is no longer\nneeded and the resulting 3-Lie algebra gives a transposed Poisson 3-Lie\nalgebra.

We propose the extension of the Weil algebra of a Lie\nalgebra to the Weil algebra of induced 3-Lie algebra by introducing in addition\nto an analog of connection and its curvature new elements and defining their\ndifferential by means of structure constants of 3-Lie algebra. We also propose\na new approach to the universal B.R.S. algebra based on the quantum triple\nNambu bracket.",

We introduce an alternative concept of BiHom-Lie algebra called\nBiHom-Lie-Leibniz algebra and study various type of $n$-ary BiHom-Lie algebras\nand BiHom-associative algebras. We show that $n$-ary BiHom-Lie-Leibniz algebra\ncan be represented by BiHom-Lie-Leibniz algebra through fundamental objets.\nMoreover, we provide some key constructions and study $n$-ary BiHom-Lie\nalgebras induced by $(n-1)$-ary BiHom-Lie algebras.",
